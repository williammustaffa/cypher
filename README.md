A simple and easy-to-use html5 game engine, which will let you code using ES6 with some GML-like code language and logic.
If you have some knowledge in GML, you already ROCK!

## Development ##
For the development we are using webpack-dev-server, which will compile/transpile your ES6 code to ES5.
To start the dev server, run the following command:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Build ##
Building is a really simple task here. 
You just need to run the following command:
```
npm build
```

## Documentation ##
Let's wait a release... Because this can change a lot in the future.
