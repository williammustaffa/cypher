This needs nodejs.

###For jGame development###

Running the project:
* run 'npm install' to install the packages
* run 'node main.js' and access this though 'localhost:port' (port specified on terminal)
* all the development should be made at 'src'
* to compile the 'src' folder into 'dist/main.js' run 'node compile.js'
* or run 'gulp' to run automatically the compile command when a file is changed
